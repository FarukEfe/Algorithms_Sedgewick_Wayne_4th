Topological order derives from the reverse postorder of a graph G.

Since the definition of reverse postorder is based on the dfs() algorithm, it is impossible to come up with
a reverse postorder that cannot be found using dfs() by definition.

Thus it is impossible to find a topological order that cannot be derived using dfs().
