Maximum number of directed edges with no parallelism is offered by each vertex directing to V - 2 nodes.

This is because there'll be one other vertex that'll point to it, which will differ for each vertex.

If each vertex points to V - 2 nodes and we repeat this for V vertices, the maximum number of directed edges
is V * (V - 2).
