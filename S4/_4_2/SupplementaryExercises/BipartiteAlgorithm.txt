Question: Verbally explain how you would devise an algorithm that would determine if a graph is bipartite or not.

Answer: Assume the graph is connected and run a bfs search starting from a node.

With each bfs call, store the adjacents of a layer in a queue. Repeat this process by replacing queue with next layer of adjacents.

For replacing vertices in queue, visit adjacents of each node. If any adjacent is already in the queue, return false.

Else, remove current vertex and store adjacents in a new queue. Repeat this for each vertex in queue.
