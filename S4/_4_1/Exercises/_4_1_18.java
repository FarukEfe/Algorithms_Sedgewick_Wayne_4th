// Solution: Run dfs from each node and find itself back. 
// Have global variable smallestSize to track smallest cycle size.
// Recursively keep a count 'size' and reset size = 0 after each dfs() iteration
// If a path back to itself exists and size < smallestSize, update smallestSize = size
// Else, continue dfs until it finishes
