This is not necessarily true. We're tunneling on the adjacents connecting to the recently added vertex, missing out of potentially better paths to some destination vertex v.

Also this method assumes that you can reach from one vertex to every other vertex, which is not necessarily the case.
Using this method may result in incomplete tree if we end up at a vertex with no outgoing edges before including all vertices.
