The time complexity of PrimMST comes from using pq.delMin(), which is ~ O(log(n)) times for n < E edges inside it.

However if we used a distTo[] array to get the minimum edge, search for minimum edge would be linear.

Repeating this until the list is empty, the new time complexity would likely be ~ O(E^2)
