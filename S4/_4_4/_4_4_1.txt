False. If some weights are negative, Bellman-Ford would give us some solution. 

However, say a positive constant that is bigger in magnitude than the most negative weight would make all weights positive.

The new graph would have a solution (using Dijkstra's) to the shortest path problem that is incorrect for the original graph with negative weights.
