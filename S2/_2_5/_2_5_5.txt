Selection sort is not stable since it performs at a polynomial (quadratic) time complexity EVEN IN THE BEST CASE OF A SORTED LIST.

Due to this reason, selection sort will run poorly slow on all cases of the data, despite the distribution of values.

When reaching large amounts of data, selection sort will take hours, or days to run.

Selection sort is not a stable algorithm.
