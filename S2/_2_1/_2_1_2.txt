To recall how selection sort works, it replaces the current index with the minimum item in the list that comes after it.

Even though we're traversing the list from each entry, the amount of exchanges per individual item is limited. There's two situations:

 - The item is already where it belongs: 0 exchanges
 - The item is the maximum (not at the end): 1 exchange
 - The item is exchanged before the outer loop reaches it: 1 exchange
 - The item is smaller than where it belongs, but not maximum: 2 exchanges

The maximum amount of exchanges for a single item is 2 and the minimum amount of exchanges is 0.
