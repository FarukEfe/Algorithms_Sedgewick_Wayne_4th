It is in our best interest to use an unordered PQ if we're using only very few delete operations, and largely insertion operations.

Insertion in unordered PQ runs at a constant time complexity O(1).

Deletion in unordered PQ runs at a linear time complexity O(n).

Since we're predominantly using insertion, we want to take an implementation that minimizes time complexity of insert().

Unordered PQ is extremely convenient for this.
