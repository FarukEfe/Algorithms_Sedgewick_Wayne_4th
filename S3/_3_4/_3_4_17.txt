By the textbook implementation of delete(), we would first remove C from the table, and re-insert all the succeeding entries until we hit a null entry.
After removal here's the table:
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15
P  M        A     S  H  L     E               R   X

First we re-insert S (hash value 6 so keeps its place):

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15
P  M        A     S  H  L      E              R   X

Now H (hash value 4 which is occupied by a so we linear probe to nearest location):

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15
P  M        A  H  S     L      E              R   X

Apply same logic to L with hash value 6 and we get our final hash table:

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15
P  M        A  H  S  L         E              R   X
