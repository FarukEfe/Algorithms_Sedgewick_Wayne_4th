Let's visualize the tree of this weighted quick union:

                1
              / | \
             /  |  \
            /   |   \
           0    3    6
               /\     \
              2  7     \      
                        5
                       / \
                      /   \
                     4     9
                    /
                    8

If we inspect the 6-subtree, we realize that it cannot be created w. r. t. the definition fo weighted quick union.

If we 1st bind 6 and 5, then a union with 9 would have to connect 9 directly to 6 (otherwise 5 would be the root).

If we were to construct the 5-tree by the following sequence:

union(9,5)
union(8,4)
union(4,5) (so far a valid tree)

Then we wouldn't be able to bind this 5-tree to 6 as the root, since a sole node is smaller in length.
Even if we assumed that The rest of the 1-tree was created, then the 5-tree would bind directly to 1, not 6.

Knowing that there's no other way to construct the 5-tree, we see that it is impossible to achieve the proposed tree structure w. r. t. the definition of weighted quick union tree.

Therefore, the given tree CANNOT be the result of running weighted quick-union.
