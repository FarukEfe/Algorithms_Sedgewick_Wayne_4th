The following code fragment doesn't work the same as in the previous question.

By assigning x.next = t, we have overwritten the previous .next (the continuation of the list) with t. So in t.next = x.next, we basically connect t to itself.

t.next = t -> This question
t.next = x.next ( != t ) -> Previous question
