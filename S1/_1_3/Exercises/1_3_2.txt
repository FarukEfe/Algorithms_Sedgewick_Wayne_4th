Assume our initial stack is empty and we have the following sequence:

it was - the best - of times - - - it was - the - -

where "-" represents a pop command, and words represent a push command of the given word.

In this case, the final output of the stack would be as follows:

push(it) -> [it]
push(was) -> [it, was]
pop() -> [it]
push(the) -> [it, the]
push(best) -> [it, the, best]
pop() -> [it, the]
push(of, times) -> [it, the, of, times]
pop(3 times) -> [it]
push(it, was) -> [it, it, was]
pop() -> [it, it]
push(the) -> [it, it, the]
pop(2 times) -> [it]

The final stack result would be [it].
